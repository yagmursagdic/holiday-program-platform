## Repository Links
- [AccountingService Repository](https://github.com/yagmursagdic/holiday-program-platform/tree/main/AccountingService)
- [TermService Repository](https://github.com/yagmursagdic/holiday-program-platform/tree/main/TermService)

## Technology Considerations
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Framework**: Micronaut
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Messaging**: Apache Kafka

### Why This Technology?
We chose Java for its robustness and Micronaut for its lightweight microservice capabilities. PostgreSQL is a reliable relational database, and Kafka will facilitate asynchronous communication between our services.

## Current Progress
- Created the project structure for both microservices.
- Set up basic configurations for PostgreSQL and Kafka.
- Implemented Docker setup for containerization.
- Prepared initial `README.md` with team information and service details.

## How to Build and Run
